RSDKv3/v4 DECOMPILATION by RubberDuckyCooly and RMGRich
	https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly/Sonic-1-2-2013-Decompilation

	The code in this repository is a decompilation of RSDK (Retro-Engine)
	version 3 or 4. There is original code in this repo, but most of the
	code is to be functionally the same as the version of RSDK this repo
	specifies.

	This code is provided as-is, that is to say, without liability or
	warranty. Original authors of RSDK and authors of the decompilation
	are not held responsible for any damages or other claims said.
	You may copy, modify, contribute, and distribute, for public or private use,
	as long as the following are followed:

	You may not use the decompilation for commercial (any sort of profit) use.
	You must clearly specify that the decompilation and original code are
	not yours: the developers of both must be credited.

	You may not distribute assets used to run the game not directly provided
	by the repository (other than unique, modded assets).

	This license must be in all modified copies of source code, and all forks
	must follow this license.

	Original RSDK author: Christian "Taxman" Whitehead
	Decompilation authors: Rubberduckycooly and RMGRich
